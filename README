This is a tool to manage a set of headless VirtualBox virtual machines 
running on a single computer.  It is not designed to handle teleportation 
or any other features that might be wanted in an enterprise setting.

It is an executable bash script, so to install, just put it someone on
your path.

It is not currently designed to ease creation of VMs, but can be used
to modify some of their attributes.

Usage:

There are two ways to use the script.  One is to manipulate a particular
virtual machine.  The syntax for this is:

vbox VMNAME COMMAND [OPTIONS] [FLAGS]

Where:
	VMNAME = name of a valid virtual machine on the computer
	COMMAND = start|poweroff|reset|pause|resume|save|status|show|setram|setcpus|running
	OPTIONS are only used for a few commands, setram takes an amount of
		ram in MB and setcpus takes a number of cpus
		
The second way to use the script is to get general information about the
VirtualBox setup on the computer such as listing all virtual machines.
The syntax is:

vbox COMMAND

Where:
	COMMAND = list|listrunning

FLAGS can be any of the following
	-h|--host - sets the ip address to run the VRDP server on if starting
				a vm
	-p|--port - sets the port for the VRDP server to run on if starting
				a vm
	-v|--verbose - be verbose with output
	--help		get some help (not useful right now :) )
