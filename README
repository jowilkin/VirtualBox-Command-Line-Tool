This is a tool to manage a set of headless VirtualBox virtual machines 
running on a single computer.  It is not designed to handle teleportation 
or any other features that might be wanted in an enterprise setting.

It is an executable bash script, so to install, just put it someone on
your path.

It is not currently designed to ease creation of VMs, but can be used
to modify some of their attributes.
